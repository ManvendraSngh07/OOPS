write down your questions?
1. what is instance variable?
2. what is reference variable?
3. Class name starts with capital letter or small letter?
4. If I want to declare my own data-type what I can think of?
5. what do understand by term class?(class-> template...rules)
6. what do understand by term objects?
7. what do understand by term instance?
8. what do understand by term instantiate?
9. what are the 3 essential properties for objects?
10. what is stack memory?
11. what is heap memory?
12. why is dot operator used?
13. Object is stored in stack memory or heap memory?
14. What is the use of new keyword?
15. what do you mean by dynamic memory allocation?
16. Instantiate?
17. what is the constructor?
18. why we use this keyword?
19. why we have created void greeting()?
20. Student student1 = new student(); ? 
    what is left-side indicate?(compile)
    what is right-side indicate?(runtime)

21. why this keyword?
22. what are two use cases of this keyword?
23. how to call constructor from another constructor?
24. what is constructor overloading?
25. where are primitive data types stored in stack memory/heap memory?
26. where are objects stored in stack memory/heap memory?
27. why constructor() does have any return type?
28. what are wrapper classes?
29. In java we use pass by value for primitive and reference for objects why?
30. can we make primitive to behave like objects?
31. How two reference variables are pointing to same objects?
32. What are the pillars of oops?
note:- In java when, you pass objects ... reference value is passed(reference value is passed)
note:- In java when, you pass primitive .....value is passed i.e pass by value.
33. what is Integer a = 10; Integer b =20; ??(It is pass by reference because object is being created.)
34. Integer class -> final class?
35. what is final keyword?
35. Declaring variable as final vs Declaring class as final keyword(think)?
36. why final variable has to be initialised?
(Always initialise while declaring , why because you cannot change it value)
37. Final gaurantees immutability, only when the instance variable is primitive types , why??
38. what is garbage collectors?
39. In c++, destructor is used to destory object created by constructor manually ?
40. But in java, object is destroyed by garbage collector..programmer can not destroy object manually ,
but it can make garbage collector do thing when object is being destroyed?
41. what is finalizer in term of garbage collector?
note:Right before, object is freed from memory, java is going to call the garbage-collector and finalize()method.
42. whenever any object of any class A, class b, is destroyed then finalize() is called and you can check it by creating the finalize()enclosing syso in it?
43. How to see when your object is destroyed from memory?(try to do it, you will feel excited)?
44. what is override and throws throwable keyword?
45. You can tell what to do , when memory is being free from object
here we did it using, syso("object is destroyed");

topic:- packages and staticMethod , Static variable

46.  what is packages?
47.  what is the use case of packages?
48.  com.manvendra.packages.a.? what do you understand by this line?
49.  import java.util.*; // import java.Scanner;?
50.  How to create a package in visual studio?
   (javac -d . Harry.java) -> dot is very important for creating package
51.  Intellij is easier in dealing with packages
      (sout,psvm, fori)
52. package.inner??(package->folder, inner->subfolder)
53. How to view the source code of anyClass or method()??(ctrl + click)
54. what is static?Is static property related to object?
55. what is non-static?
56. Is there any single property common to all human Beings class? (Population)?
57. Static variables? static functions?
58. In order to access static variable, what we use is Classname?
    eg:     Human.population += 1   (here, human is a class)  

note:- static variable exhist in class not in object
      ->  you can declare methods and variable both as static.?
60. why main() is static?
    (before any object is being created-> It allow you to run main() -> that's why it is static)

61. why static methods can be access static data?
62. why non static methods can access static data? 


note:- when you put stuff, inside a static-context, make sure you are creating object of it.
note:- when you put stuff, inside a non-static context, you can directly call it->because object for it is created 100% Main()
At last everything, has to go inside main function.

63. what is story of:
   void fun2(){
    greeting();
   }

64. what is story of:
static void fun(){
    greeting();
}


65. why you cannot use this keyword, inside a static method?(because this is used for pointing at object)
66. what is static block?(understand it by notes)?
67. why can't outside classes be static?(it is not dependent on any other class)
68. why inner class are static?(it is dependent on outer class to create object for it to run)
69. what do we actually mean by static-stuff? using Innerclasses eg:-
70. static means it is not dependent on object, then how it is that these two objects are dependent & having uniques identities?
note:- static stuff are resolve during compile time.

71. what do you understand by System.out.println()?
72. what do you understand by Arrays.toString(new int[]{3,4,5});
73. what are annotations?
74. what is singleton class?
75. How to achieve goal of creating instance of object using constructor()?(private)
76. what is private constructor?

constructor + new keyword = creation of objects.

77. how to implement it?(refer to note/code...singleton/main.java)
